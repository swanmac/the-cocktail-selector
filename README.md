## A website to help educate the user to make an informed decision on cocktail selection.

* **_The Cocktail Selector_** is a website that provides detailed information on a list of different cocktails enabling the user to make an informed decision when choosing a cocktail. 

* **The Layout** - Navigation links at the top of the page are to "Home" the Home page and "About" the About page. Below the navigation links is the Search Form. The Search Form is labeled "Search Your Favorite Cocktail" and contains a text input bar and a Start Over button.

* **Search Form** - The search form allows the user to select a single or group of cocktails by entering the first or one of the letters in the name of the cocktail into the text input bar. The Start Over button is used to reset the search form or start over.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
