# Cocktail_Selector

## A website to help educate the user to make an informed decision on cocktail selection.

* **_The Cocktail Selector_** is a website that provides detailed information on a list of different cocktails enabling the user to make an informed decision when choosing a cocktail. 

* **The Layout** - Navigation links at the top of the page are to "Home" the Home page and "About" the About page. Below the navigation links is the Search Form. The Search Form is labeled "Search Your Favorite Cocktail" and contains a text input bar and a Start Over button.

* **Search Form** - The search form allows the user to select a single or group of cocktails by entering the first or one of the letters in the name of the cocktail into the text input bar. The Start Over button is used to reset the search form or start over.

* To start, you can take one of two actions.

* **Action one:** Enter the first or one of the letters in the name of your favorite cocktail into the search form text input bar. The search results will automatically display below in the list of cocktails.

* After taking Action one, you will be shown either a group of cocktails or one cocktail matching your search of cocktails that their name contains the letter or letters that you have entered into the search form text input bar. At this point you may choose one of the cocktails displayed in the search results and then select the "Details" button on that specific cocktail.

* **Action two:** Scroll down the page and select the "Details" button on any of the cocktails that are already displayed.

* **Details Page** - When a user clicks on the "Details" button on an individual cocktail, they are taken to a page that displays that specific individual cocktail page.

* **Cocktail Page** - On the individual cocktail page, they receive more information about that specific cocktail including: the cocktail image, name, category, info (alcoholic or not), instructions on how to prepare the cocktail, and a list of ingredients.

* **Back Home** - At the top of the "Details Page" there is a clickable button labeled "Back Home" which when clicked by the user will take the user back to the "Home" page to enable them to start over and create another search from the search form text input bar.

* **About Page** - The About Page is on a clickable Navigation link in the header. When a user clicks the "About" link in the navigation bar, they are taken to the "About Us" page which has a short paragraph welcoming the visitor to the website and explaining how to use the site.
